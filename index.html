      <h2>This is the year we #ChangeTheDebate.</h2>
      <p>On July 30-31, 20 candidates will walk onstage in Detroit. They'll ask for our votes. We'll ask them to give a
        damn about our lives.</p>
      <p>Join us in Detroit to turn the tide of history together. For our future. For justice. For humanity. Let's
        #ChangeTheDebate.</p>
    </section>
    <div class="background questions"></div>
    <section id="questions">
      <h2>Answers to your questions</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>What are our demands?</dt>
        <dd>We demand that all candidates reject fossil fuel money, support a “climate debate”, and make the Green New
          Deal a Day 1 priority.</dd>

        <dt>I’m not sure if I can get to Detroit. Should I still sign up?</dt>
        <dd>Yes! Anyone who wants to #ChangeTheDebate should register on this page. Volunteers across the country will
          be organizing busses, carpools and trains to get as many people as possible to Detroit. We’ll share more
          information about transportation and financial support soon and also have opportunities for people to join in
          from wherever they live. So, no matter who you are or where you live, you should register to attend
          #ChangeTheDebate.</dd>

        <dt>What's the plan of action?</dt>
        <dd>Details are being worked out and will be shared as the date approaches. As of now, part of the plan is to
          gather by the thousands and set up a “People’s Stage” near the official Presidential Debate Location and
          challenge the candidates to come speak on our terms. Over 24 hours, we’ll tell our own stories on the People’s
          Stage as well. We’ll hold vigil for the people and places we have already lost, and the ones that will be
          lost. We’ll express our fear for the future, and the anger of our generation to have been abandoned by the
          adults in the room. Together, we’ll continue what we started last November, which is to bring a moral
          reckoning on the climate crisis to the heart of the American political conversation, and to shake this corrupt
          political establishment to its core.</dd>

        <dt>When and where will it be?</dt>
        <dd>Detroit, Michigan. July 30-31. The debate will take place over two nights, with 10 candidates on stage each
          night.</dd>

        <dt>What can I do between now and July?</dt>
        <dd>When you sign up to attend #ChangeTheDebate, you'll have an option to volunteer as a "Local Recruitment
          Captain." Recruitment Captains will be part of a massive, national team to bring as many people as possible to
          Detroit. Anyone who wants to help with Change The Debate should register as a Local Recruitment Captain - it
          doesn't matter if you've never done anything like this before!</dd>

        <dt>What is the Sunrise National Summit?</dt>
        <dd>We’re hosting the first Sunrise National Summit before the #ChangeTheDebate mobilization. The Summit will be
          a day and half long on July 29-30th. When you sign up, you’ll receive an link by email to apply to join us at
          the Summit!</dd>
